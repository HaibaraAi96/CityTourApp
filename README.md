# CityTourApp: E-Commerce Platform for Private Tour

This project is inspired by Uber app, which provides a successful e-commerce platform that caters "taxi trade" where any registered private driver can be a taxi service provider to meet the rider's requirements.

This project focuses on implementing an android application of such requirements and adds more functions for tourism, so that the user can publish a request consisting a tour plan generated by this app and wait for a local driver who could offer a ride as well as make suggestions for this trip. To achieve this, optimizing the route and price calculation are necessary. This app could contribute to travel intelligence and sharing economy, providing business opportunities for both tourism and taxi industries.

This project develops an Android application for the individualized city tour that aims to cater "sightseeing tour trade" where any registered private driver can be a tour guide for tourists. The user is allowed to create a list of places with a priority, and this app could generate a trip route and calculate the cost of travel. The user could publish the generated ride as a request to the registered private drivers as a potential trade deal. Vice-versa the registered private drivers could generate a suggested tour with a fairly cost calculated by this app and advertise to users. To calculate the price and the route, this project made alternations based on Ant Colony Algorithm and Dijkstra Algorithm to optimize the route and considered reasonable factors including distance, time and labour to calculate the price. Apart from implementing the required functions, additional features for proper tourism purposes including real-time weather searching functions, temperature sensor and POI search are also achieved.
